<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The following guide to the study of animals is intended
for pupils in secondary schools. It was prepared by the
authors at the request of the Biology Round Table, an
association composed of the teachers of Biology in the
Chicago High Schools, to whom the authors wish to take
this opportunity of expressing their appreciation of the
many helpful suggestions and criticisms of the manuscript.</p>

<p>The time has passed when a high school course in
zoölogy consists simply of a somewhat simplified edition
of a similar course in college. All teachers now recognize
that the <span class="sic" title="[sic]">motivization</span> of any course should be its
adaptability to the needs of the student, and that zoölogy
must be taught from the standpoint of the student rather
than that of the subject. In preparing this guide, the
authors have tried to keep these points in mind.</p>

<p>The matter of presentation, the order of topics, and the
choice of material has been much discussed, but the trend
of opinion has finally set in toward an ecological rather
than a type study of animals; that there should be in the
case of young students a brief study of rather a large
number of animals to bring out some general biological
law, rather than an exhaustive study of a very few types.
It is further recognized that the use of a reference library
is absolutely essential in connection with and to supplement
the laboratory work, as there are some topics beyond
the ability of the young student for original investigation<a class="pagenum" name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv" title="[Pg iv]"></a>
as well as impossible in the amount of time usually allotted
to the subject in our crowded curricula. Of great importance
is the economic side of zoölogy, especially its bearing
upon the applied sciences of medicine, sanitation, household
science, and agriculture, and this phase has received
special attention in this guide.</p>

<p>The desirability of field work has always been recognized,
but the special conditions under which schools must
work are so variable as to make any set directions for
field work of little value, and so they have in most cases
been omitted in this work. Each teacher can easily give
such special direction for collecting material and study
in the field as the locality of the school and the time available
for it shall determine.</p>

<p>Since zoölogy will probably be the pupil's first laboratory
science, the authors have preceded the more formal portion
of the manual with a series of short exercises on
familiar and easily obtained animals in order to introduce
the pupil to the laboratory method and to stimulate his
interest, training him at the outset to be constantly on the
outlook for specimens and to show him how much may
be learned from common things right around him, if he
will only use his eyes. We have also begun the more
formal portion of the guide with insects, since in the fall
they are easily collected and may be studied alive. They
illustrate, moreover, the principles of classification and
method of using keys and other means of finding out the
names of animals. This would seem to be pedagogically
sound, for some recent experiments with pupils show that
the first question that comes into a child's mind upon
seeing a new or strange specimen is "What is it?"</p>

<p>A larger portion of the guide is given to the chordates
than is usually the case. The authors also believe that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_v" id="Page_v" title="[Pg v]"></a>
this is correct and in accord with the natural interest of
the pupil. It will serve to connect his zoölogy more
closely with his daily experiences.</p>

<p>There is material enough provided to allow the teacher
a chance to select that best adapted to his purposes or
conditions as well as to provide for those schools that
give more than one year to zoölogy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
INTRODUCTORY STUDIES OF LIVING ANIMALS</h2>


<p>In the following brief exercises the primary purpose is
to arouse an active, attentive interest on the part of the
pupil in various forms of animal life which may be at
hand, reminding him of what and how various creatures
eat, how they breathe, how they get ideas of the world,
how they get about, and perhaps how they succeed where
others fail. Of secondary importance is the introduction
of laboratory methods by easy stages. The pupil should
feel that his natural curiosity is only being directed to
definite ends and that he is free to investigate in his own
way.</p>

<p>The types here given are only a few of the many to be
found in the early fall, and these exercises in several cases
may be used for other forms than those definitely mentioned.
There should be a great deal of promiscuous collecting
by the class, and in the mass of material gathered
the following types will probably be fairly abundant.</p>


<h4><a name="FLY" id="FLY"></a>THE LIVING FLY</h4>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Living flies in cages and individual specimens in small
wide-mouth vials with cotton stoppers for the admission of
air. Sugar crystals may be used for feeding. Simple
lenses.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" id="Page_2" title="[Pg 2]"></a></p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>Notice the division of the body into three regions:
head, thorax, and abdomen. The six legs, the large
wings, and the small feelers may be easily found, as are
the large eyes, the extensible mouth, and beneath the
larger wings the small undeveloped ones looking like

<li>Since this creature is destined to become a flying or
walking insect, what organs will have to appear? Is
there any indication of these structures at present?</li>

<li>Give the color of the specimen, and explain how the
presence or absence of strong light seems to have affected
the color. Is this effect usual in animals or plants that
you know?</li>

<li>Tell how the animal gets from place to place, describing
any special structures you find which aid in this work.</li>

<li>How can you tell the head end? Tell how the
amount of work that the mouth and mouth parts do affects
their size and indirectly that of the region where they are.</li>

<li>What senses and sense organs has the maggot?
Test any of these senses or organs gently, by any means
at your disposal, or recall any experience you have had
along this line. Which senses or organs seem to be best
developed?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">Explain briefly how the active or sluggish habits either determine

<li>Is the roach a quick or a slow moving animal? How
does it get about,&mdash;by running, jumping, walking, crawling,
swimming, or flying? Turn your specimen on its back
and see how it recovers its proper position. Notice the
relative size and development of the wings and their use in
flying.</li>

<li>If uninjured, your specimen has six legs. Why don't
they step on each other? Notice the stiff hairs on the legs
and the white pads under the feet. How would these
structures be useful to the animal?</li>

<li>The large, black, shiny eyes are on the front and

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" id="Page_8" title="[Pg 8]"></a></p>
<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>Notice the form and size of your specimen, its color,
the number of its legs and of its feelers. Find the eyes;
the two large eyes, a tiny one between the two feelers,
and near the inner edge of each large eye, another tiny
one. With a lens notice the markings on the large eyes.
Find the mouth, and note its lips and finger-like feelers.
Draw out an outer wing, and then carefully draw out the
delicate under wing, allowing them both to fold into place
again. Under the wings find the circular or crescent-shaped
membranes, the eardrums. Watch the grasshopper's
body expand and contract in breathing, and find
the small breathing holes along each side the body. Compare
its rate of breathing with your own.</p>

<h4><a name="BUTTERFLY_OR_MOTH" id="BUTTERFLY_OR_MOTH"></a>THE LIVING BUTTERFLY OR MOTH</h4>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Individual specimens in large jars or cages, and other
specimens in cages with foliage; simple lenses and a
needle or pin.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>Butterflies may generally be distinguished from moths
by their habit of holding their wings together above them
when at rest, by the feelers which are knobbed at the
end, and by the rather slender abdomen. Moths generally
either fold their wings or hold them outstretched, their
feelers are not knobbed, and their bodies are rather
bulky.</p>

<p>Observe these points in your specimen and the colors
of the upper and under sides of the wings. Find the
large eyes and examine them with a lens. With the needle
or pin carefully uncoil the sucking tube which you may
find under the head between two shields. Note the
fuzziness of the body and the "dust" which covers the
wings. Examine some of this dust under a lens.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Is your specimen a butterfly or a moth? Prove your
statement. If possible, give the name of your specimen.</li>

<li>Write a description of your specimen&mdash;its size,
general color, and special color pattern.</li>

<li>Describe the sucking tube, or "proboscis," and
name some flowers from which it might obtain nectar.
Try to find out how the tube is operated.</li>

<li>Why is it that moths and butterflies never bite? Do
they sting? How do you think they protect themselves
from enemies?</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" id="Page_10" title="[Pg 10]"></a>
State how the fuzz and dust on your specimen might
influence a bird's liking for it.</li>

<li>Contrast the size and usefulness of the wings of the
butterfly with those of some other insect you know about;
contrast their legs; state how development of one set of
structures may cause another set to be simple or feeble.</li>

<li>Most moths are active by night. What explanation
can you give for their large eyes and expanded feelers?
Feelers of insects may be for any or all of the following:
touch, taste, smell, and hearing.</li>

<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Living caterpillars in cages or covered jars for individual
study, and other specimens in cages with foliage for food
or concealment.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>The pupil should observe the general form and external
construction of the caterpillar, watching it feeding, in
action, and at rest.</p>

<p>Notice how the creature moves. Find its head, its
segments (similar divisions of the body), and its breathing
holes along the sides of the body. Try to find its eyes,
any feelers, wings or paddles. Try to loosen it from its
support; find the tiny hooks on the feet for clinging fast.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Give the general color of your specimen and explain
how this color may make it conspicuous or may aid its
concealment.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" id="Page_11" title="[Pg 11]"></a>
Describe the outer surface or covering of the caterpillar.
What structures, if any, are there, which might
make the animal distasteful or inedible?</li>

<li>How many pairs of legs are there? How are they
distributed along the body? Counting the segments, state
which ones bear no legs.</li>

<li>To what extent do the legs act in locomotion? Are
they mere organs for attachment while the body swings
forward and backward, or do the legs do this, as in a
horse? Make a complete statement.</li>

<li>Notice the openings of the internal breathing tubes.
How are they protected against dust and other foreign
matter?</li>

<li>Does the caterpillar seem to be a warm-blooded
animal? State how the free access of air along the body
would influence internal temperature.</li>

<li>What do you know about a caterpillar's appetite?
How might caterpillars be beneficial or harmful? What
means has nature of holding their numbers in check?</li>

<li>Recalling that caterpillars finally "sleep" for several
days or weeks and awaken as winged creatures, how can you
account for their appetites?</li>

<h4><a name="TUSSOCK_MOTH" id="TUSSOCK_MOTH"></a>THE TUSSOCK MOTH</h4>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Directions for the study of the caterpillar stage will be
found in the exercise "The Living Caterpillar," and
directions for the study of the adult male form will be
found in the exercise "The Living Butterfly or Moth."
The female tussock moth is a wingless, thick-bodied
creature, gray in color, very downy, and about three
fourths of an inch long. The following directions apply<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" id="Page_12" title="[Pg 12]"></a>
more particularly to the study of the cocoons and the
general harmfulness of the tussock moth.</p>

<p>This exercise may be done best outside of the classroom,
the pupil answering the questions on scrap paper and
rewriting these notes in the laboratory. Living caterpillars,
cocoons, some of them bearing their frothy masses of
wax and eggs, pupæ, and adult moths of both sexes may be
used in the laboratory.</p>


<h6>Observations and Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>On what kinds of trees are the cocoons and the
caterpillars generally found? What effect have the caterpillars
on the trees, and what may possibly be the final
effect upon the trees of the locality or the entire district?</li>

<li>Upon what part of the tree are the cocoons made,
and why? Where on the bark are they, and why?</li>

<li>Is the opening of the cocoon at the upper or the
lower end? What reason can you assign for this?</li>

<li>Count the number of cocoons upon the entire tree
or estimate it by counting those upon a part of the tree.
Now count the number of eggs on a cocoon. Assuming
that one half of the cocoons bear eggs, calculate the
number of caterpillars on a tree next year.</li>

<li>How is the waxy covering of the eggs a particularly
good protection against winter weather?</li>

<li>Investigate the interiors of several cocoons and state
what you find.</li>

<li>On the pupa find the jointed and tapering hinder
end, abdomen, and at the head region and lying along the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" id="Page_13" title="[Pg 13]"></a>
under side, the marks of the legs and the feelers, and possibly
the wings, all pressed close against the body. Find
also the breathing pores along the sides of the abdomen.</li>

<li>Unlikeness between male and female is called
"sexual dimorphism."  Explain how the tussock moth
shows this. For what work does each form seem particularly
adapted?</li>

<li>What methods would you use that the tussock moth
might be destroyed or kept out of a community?</li>
</ol>

<p class="blockquot">The numerous small worm-like creatures often found are the caterpillar
stages of another insect, an ichneumon fly, which laid its eggs
under the skin of the tussock caterpillar. How has their development
affected that of the tussock moth? What great result does nature
accomplish by this arrangement?</p>

<h4><a name="BEETLE" id="BEETLE"></a>THE LIVING BEETLE</h4>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Living beetles in cages, together with portions of the
plant upon which they are found; or if water beetles are
used, they should be kept in aquaria. Individual specimens
in battery jars or wide-mouth bottles, and preserved
beetles in pans or vials for reference.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Upon what plant or in what surroundings is your
kind of beetle generally found? If you can, give its common
name.</li>

<li>What is the length, breadth, and thickness of your
beetle? Would you describe it as a "small" insect or a
"large" one?</li>

<li>Of what general color is it? Describe any color
markings you see.</li>

<li>If any of the legs differ from the others or are of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" id="Page_14" title="[Pg 14]"></a>
peculiar shape or length, describe them and tell what you
think they may be fitted to do.</li>

<li>As a rule, beetles have harder "shells" than other
insects. Does this shell completely inclose the body, or
can you find any soft parts exposed? How are the head,
thorax, and abdomen joined so as to carry out the apparent
purpose of protection? What is the outline of the body&mdash;a
continuous line or one with many irregularities?</li>

<li>If possible, try to lift up one side of the "shell" from
the hinder end of the body. You will discover that this
portion of the shell is a pair of hard sheath wings, and beneath
them is another pair. How are the under ones
unlike the upper in size and texture? in use? in arrangement
when not in use?</li>

<li>Does a beetle spend most of its life on the wing, like
bees and flies? How might the body covering and the
structure of the outer wings affect or determine the beetle's
habits, even against its will?</li>

<li>Are the feelers or are the eyes of your specimen
more easily distinguished? Upon which of the special
senses does it seem to place most dependence?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">Is your kind of beetle good for anything, either in nature or in
human affairs? Make a statement regarding what good or what harm
it may do.</li>

<h6>Observations.</h6>

<ol>
<li>What is the color and the shape of the larva? how
long is it? Notice in what surroundings in the water the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" id="Page_15" title="[Pg 15]"></a>
larva lives, and answer to yourself how its form and color
would protect it in those surroundings.</li>

<li>Since the larva is an insect, though immature, its
body is composed of three regions: head, thorax, and
abdomen. How do these regions differ from each other?</li>

<li>What structures has your specimen to enable it to
move from place to place? If fully developed wings are
not present, what indication is there of their being
formed?</li>

<li>What sense organs has the larva? Which ones
seem to be the largest and most useful?</li>

<li>Although the aquatic larva is preparing for adult
life in the air, there should be some arrangement for
securing air in the water. Where do you find outgrowths
of the skin which might increase the air-absorbing surface?
How many of these structures are there? Look within
them for the air tubes,&mdash;fine branching black lines.</li>

<li>If possible, without injury to the specimen, examine
the larva's mouth. Try to discover how it is used and
how it is protected when not in use.</li>

<h5>Water Bugs</h5>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Water bugs and beetles of several species in small
aquaria covered with a wire net.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<ol>
<li>With what legs does the bug swim? Describe their
appearance and tell how used and how fitted for this use.
Which legs are not used in swimming?</li>

<li>Remove the bug from the water for a moment to test
other methods of locomotion, as jumping, crawling, flying.
What do you discover?</li>

<li>Watch the bug as it gets a fresh supply of air, and
describe the process. Where is the air stored for use when
under water? Does the bug sink or rise when it stops
swimming? Why?</li>

<li>Identify the bug's mouth parts. What is their appearance
and probable manner of use? How are the forelegs
fitted for grasping food?</li>

<li>What is the shape of the body? What is the position<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" id="Page_18" title="[Pg 18]"></a>
of the wings? Do the two cover (fore) wings meet in a
straight line or do they cross at their tips? Are they
smooth throughout and sheath-like, or are they thick at the
base and thin at the tips?</li>
</ol>


<h6>Summary.</h6>

<p>Summarize your study of the bug by enumerating the
various ways the bug is adapted for life in the water.</p>


<h5>Water Beetles</h5>

<p>Use the same questions for the study of water beetles as
for water bugs. In addition answer the following:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify the eyes of the whirligig beetle and note their
peculiar construction. How can you explain this peculiar
form of the eyes on the basis of use? Why are the antennæ
of both water bugs and beetles so small?</li>

of animals. The use of keys in finding the names of
animals.</p>


<h4><a name="FIELD_STUDIES" id="FIELD_STUDIES"></a>1. FIELD STUDIES</h4>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>1. <em>Boxes</em> for carrying insects. 2. A <em>net</em>. This may be
homemade, using mosquito netting or fish net and a stout
wire. If it is to be used for a dragnet for water insects,
the wire must be stout and the netting strong. Make the
net twice as long as wide. 3. A <em>cyanide jar</em> for killing insects.
4. A few <em>paper triangles</em> for carrying butterflies.
5. A <em>notebook</em>.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Your instructor will give directions for obtaining the material
called for in 3, 4, and 5.</p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Look carefully and quietly in the various situations noted
below. Do not be in a hurry. Weedy meadows or vacant
lots and neglected roadsides are good places for your first
trips. Note concerning each insect found: (<i>a</i>) its name or
something by which to identify it, (<i>b</i>) where you found it,
(<i>c</i>) what it was doing, (<i>d</i>) its probable food. Record these
observations in your notebook. Make a special study of
such insects as your instructor may designate.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" id="Page_21" title="[Pg 21]"></a></p>


<h5>Where to look for Various Insects</h5>

<dl>
<dt>Grasshoppers, locusts, katydids.</dt><dd> Look along roadsides,
waste places, gardens, especially weedy ones, weedy lots,
and grassy meadows and pastures.</dd>

<dt>Crickets.</dt><dd> Under old boards, along the edges of board
or stone walks, along fences.</dd>

<dt>Beetles.</dt><dd> Same locations as for crickets, and also on
flowering plants, under loose bark of trees and stumps, in
rotten logs, etc. For <i>water beetles</i> drag edges of ponds
and streams.</dd>

<dt>Dragon flies.</dt><dd> Along water-courses, ponds, and swamps.
Drag ponds and ditches for larvæ.</dd>

<dt>Bees.</dt><dd> On flowering plants, especially on large patches
of wild asters, golden-rods, and thistles.</dd>

<dt>Wasps.</dt><dd> Sandy stretches,&mdash;especially along the water,&mdash;among
flowering plants, under the eaves and roofs of outbuildings.
Nests may be found in these latter places.</dd>

<dt>Butterflies and moths.</dt><dd> In fields where there are many
flowering plants; look carefully on the leaves of plants for
caterpillars, and for eggs. Also look very carefully on the
under side of leaves, on twigs, and on the bark of trees for
chrysalids of butterflies and cocoons of moths.</dd>

<dt>Bugs.</dt><dd> In same locations as for bees and grasshoppers
and water beetles. Also on fruit.</dd>

<dt>Aphids.</dt><dd> On the fresh growing tops of plants.</dd>

<dt>Tree hoppers.</dt><dd> On trees and shrubs. Hold your net on the
under side of branches and shake the branch vigorously.</dd>

<dt>Flies.</dt><dd> Around decaying substances, as garbage, fruit,
etc.; on flowering plants.</dd>

<dt>Ants.</dt><dd> Sandy waste places, decayed logs, along walks,
often in kitchens.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;At night many kinds of insects fly around electric lights or
into open windows, attracted by the light and may easily be collected.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" id="Page_22" title="[Pg 22]"></a></p>


<h5>Form for Field Trip Report</h5>

<p>The notes taken on a field trip may be conveniently
tabulated for permanent record in the form indicated below:&mdash;</p>

<div class="form">
<span class="smcap center">Field Trip Report</span><br />
Date________ Time________ Locality________ Pupil's Name________
<table summary="field trip report">

<td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr></table>
</div>

<p>In case the name of the insect is not known to you, use a
number and some designation as to color or other mark by
which it may be known until you have leisure to look up
its name by means of keys or books on insects.</p>


<h5>Special Field Studies</h5>

<p>The questions below may be used for a more careful
field study of any insect.</p>

<ol>
<li>Just where was the insect found?</li>

<li>Note carefully what the insects are doing before they
are disturbed by your presence. What did the insects do
when you disturbed them? If you think this related to
securing safety, explain what leads you to think so.</li>

<li>What senses do you conclude are well developed?
Reason for your conclusion.</li>

<li>Has the insect a home? If so, what is its character?</li>

<li>What is the color? What is the relation between the
color of the insect and its surroundings?</li>

<li>Is the insect solitary in its habits or associated with
others of the same species? If in association with others,
note the numbers, and what they are doing.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" id="Page_23" title="[Pg 23]"></a>
What modes of locomotion do you observe in this
insect? Which is the most common? If it flies or jumps,
note the distance.</li>

<li>If you find the young, note whether they differ from
the adult in general appearance, and if so, in what ways
they differ. Do they differ in food?</li>

<li>What other insects do you find in the same habitat?</li>

many as you can with examples of insects that use the
habitat.</li>

<li>Give examples to show how greatly the food of
insects and the method of obtaining it varies.</li>

<li>Give some illustrations of the great muscular development
of insects. Why is this needed?</li>

affected the structure and mode of life of the insects.</li>
</ol>


<h5>Classification</h5>

<ol>
<li>By means of illustrations from your studies of
insects show how classification is based upon likeness of

THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION</h2>


<h4><a name="A_STUDY_OF_THE_CELL" id="A_STUDY_OF_THE_CELL"></a>1. A STUDY OF THE CELL AND OF PROTOZOA</h4>

<p class="secdesc">To show what Single Cells can Do</p>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Some single cells of plant or animal tissue, stained to
show structure. Slides of a one-celled animal, stained.
Living one-celled animals.</p>


<h6>Definitions.</h6>

<dl>
<dt>Cell,</dt><dd> the smallest living unit.</dd>

<dt>Protoplasm,</dt><dd> the living material composing the cell.</dd>

<dt>Nucleus,</dt><dd> a dense bit of protoplasm, usually near the center
of the cell, often staining dark.</dd>

<dt>Cytoplasm,</dt><dd> the less dense protoplasm outside of the nucleus,
usually taking a lighter stain.</dd>

<dt>Nucleolus, paranucleus <span class="noni">or</span> micronucleus,</dt><dd> a very small,
dense, dark-staining body, either within the nucleus (nucleolus)
or near it (paranucleus or micronucleus)</dd>

<dt>Cell wall,</dt><dd> the lifeless membrane surrounding many cells,
secreted by the protoplasm.</dd>

<dt>Food balls,</dt><dd> bits of food inside the cells of many one-celled
animals, usually showing through the walls.</dd>

<dt>Food vacuole,</dt><dd> a small drop of water containing digestive
material and a food ball.</dd>

<dt><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" id="Page_45" title="[Pg 45]"></a>
Contracting <span class="noni">or</span> pulsating vacuoles,</dt><dd> small, clear spots in
the cell, filled with water. In the living cell these disappear
at intervals and then appear again.</dd>

<dt>Oral groove,</dt><dd> a funnel-shaped groove in one side of some
one-celled animals, conducting food to the mouth. In
paramecium it often shows as an oblique line when the
animal rolls.</dd>

<dt>Gullet,</dt><dd> the inner end of the oral groove.</dd>

<dt>Cilia,</dt><dd> numerous minute, vibrating, protoplasmic hairs on
the surface of many cells.</dd>

<dt>Respiration,</dt><dd> the passage of oxygen into the tissues of a
living organism and of carbon dioxide out of them. These
gases can pass through any thin, moist, organic membrane.
When such a membrane separates two fluids which differ
in the amount of oxygen they contain, oxygen passes to
the fluid containing the smaller amount.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The same is true
of carbon dioxide. Respiration is believed to occur in all
living organisms.</dd>

<dt>Digestion,</dt><dd> the process of making food materials soluble,
so that they can pass through membranes and be used to
build up protoplasm. A few forms of cells are able to
take in solid food and digest it in their protoplasm, but
most cells can admit only fluid food.</dd>

<dt>Fission,</dt><dd> a method of reproduction used in all cells, by
which a cell divides itself into two, usually through the center.
In some one-celled animals this may be preceded by
<i>conjugation</i>, when two animals unite temporarily and exchange
nuclear substance; or in some forms two cells may
fuse and the resulting cell may divide. <i>Budding</i> is a form
of fission in which a small projection is formed on the
parent cell and then cut off, making a new individual.</dd>

<h6>Observations.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Examine a single cell, stained to show structure.
Identify the nucleus, cytoplasm, and, if present, the
nucleolus or the micronucleus, and the cell wall. Draw to
show the form of the cell and the details of its structure.
Label all details.</li>

<li>Examine some stained paramecia. Select a typical
one and identify in it nucleus, micronucleus, cytoplasm,
and cell wall or cell membrane. You may also be able to
see vacuoles, looking like holes in the stained protoplasm.
Give reasons for considering this animal to be a single cell.
Draw one, to show its cellular structure. Label all details.</li>

<li>Clean a slide and cover glass, place a drop of water
containing living paramecia on the slide, cover it, and
examine. What structures do you see which you saw in
the stained paramecia? What structures do not show?
Identify any new structures you may observe. Identify also
the leading end and the side containing the oral groove.</li>

<li>Describe the shape of the animal.

<p class="blockquot">What is the actual length of the animal?</p></li>

<li>After watching the animal for some time, describe
the path followed by a given specimen as it crosses the
field of the microscope. What reason can you see, if any,
why this paramecium is moving? What external factors,
if any, seem to determine the path it follows?</li>

<li>How rapidly do paramecia really move? What
structures do they use in locomotion?

<p class="blockquot">How do they manage to move in one direction, instead of alternately
backward and forward? How do they manage to move in a straight
line, though their bodies are not symmetrical?</p></li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" id="Page_47" title="[Pg 47]"></a>
What is the food of the paramecia? How do they
find it? Find a specimen at rest and watch the oral
groove. Suggest a method by which food may be collected
into it. If possible, note the process of swallowing,
and the resulting food ball.

<p class="blockquot"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;If powdered carmine be placed in the water with some paramecia,
it can be seen in the food balls a half hour or so later.</p></li>

<li>Where are the food balls located?  Watch them
in an individual until you notice their motion. Where
are the larger food balls? the smaller ones? Assuming
them to have been of approximately equal sizes when
they were taken in, how can you account for differences
now?</li>

<li>Where are the contracting vacuoles? How many
are there? How often does one contract?

<p class="blockquot">What is their function?</p></li>

<li>As you have been studying paramecia, to what
external influences (as contact, heat, light, etc.) have you
seen them respond? How do they show it when they do
respond? Is such a response an advantage to them or
not? What would be the result if they were not able to
detect changes in their surroundings?</li>

<li>Where does respiration occur in paramecia?
Where do they obtain their supply of oxygen?</li>

<li>Among the paramecia you are studying you
usually find at least one in the process of fission. Watch
it until the halves separate, if you can. Compare the
halves. Do they rank as parent and offspring? If so,
which is which? If not, which are they, parent or offspring?</li>

<li>If you happen to find a pair conjugating, notice the
process, as far as you can, in the living animals.</li>

paramecium.</span></li>

<li><span>Drawings to show that paramecia are constant in
shape and yet flexible.</span></li>

This may be from a permanent preparation.</span></li>

<li><span>A drawing to show paramecia conjugating. This
also may be from a permanent preparation.</span></li>

<li><span>Instead of all these separate drawings they may be

and in it draw all necessary figures, to show the facts
called for in the first five drawings and any other facts you
have observed about living protozoa. Make the whole
drawing to scale.</span></li>
</ol>


<h5>Summary of Important Points in the Study of Paramecia</h5>

<ol>
<li>Look back over your study of paramecia and list the
different kinds of work you saw paramecia doing; also the
kinds of work you infer they can do. What organs have
they to use? When there is no organ to do a given thing,
<i>e.g.</i> to digest food, how is the work done?</li>

<li>What conditions are favorable to paramecia? Why
are they so numerous under favorable conditions?</li>

<li>What would you call a successful animal? Are
paramecia successful? Give reasons why they are or are
not.</li>
</ol>


<h5><a name="COMPARATIVE_STUDY_OF_PROTOZOA" id="COMPARATIVE_STUDY_OF_PROTOZOA"></a>Comparative Study of Protozoa</h5>

<p>To enlarge your idea of what a cell can do, spend as
much more time on the one-celled animals as your course<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" id="Page_49" title="[Pg 49]"></a>
will permit. Any stagnant water may furnish several
kinds. By means of reference books, identify as many as
you can. In each case notice:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Its size, shape and general appearance, comparing
and contrasting it with paramecium.</li>

<li>Its usual surroundings, <i>i.e.</i> the conditions it has to
meet.</li>

<li>The means it has of finding out facts about its
surroundings.</li>

<li>The means it has of adjusting itself to its surroundings.
For example, is it stationary? If so, what does it
do when conditions change? Is it locomotory? If so,
how effective is its locomotion?</li>

<li>What is its food? How does it find food?</li>

<li>Can it do as many kinds of work as paramecium
can? Can it do any that paramecium cannot do? If so,
what?</li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="SPONGES" id="SPONGES"></a>2. A STUDY OF SPONGES</h4>

<p class="secdesc">To show how cells loosely associated may work together.</p>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>The simplest of the many-celled animals are the sponges,
which, with one exception, are salt-water forms. That
one, the spongilla, is not easily found and is very difficult
to maintain in the laboratory. For these reasons the material
for this study is very meager, except at the seashore,
and much of the work must be done from diagrams and
reference books. Small simple preserved sponges and
complex toilet sponge skeletons will also be used.</p>


<h6>Definitions.</h6>

<dl>
<dt>Body wall,</dt><dd> the outer wall in bodies of the many-celled
animals.</dd>

<dt>Central cavity,</dt><dd> the cavity surrounded by the body wall
in the simpler many-celled animals, as in the sponges.</dd>

<dt>Canals,</dt><dd> channels through the body walls of sponges.</dd>

<dt>Inhalent pores,</dt><dd> the outer ends of the canals.</dd>

<dt>Ostia,</dt><dd> the inner ends of the canals.</dd>

<dt>Osculum,</dt><dd> the large opening of the central cavity, at the
distal end of the sponge.</dd>

<dt>Spicules,</dt><dd> tiny needles of mineral substance found in the
walls of many sponges.</dd>

<dt>Fibers,</dt><dd> flexible threads of horny material found in the
walls of many sponges.</dd>

<dt>Endoderm cells,</dt><dd> cells lining the canals. They have cilia
or flagella (projections larger than cilia).</dd>

<dt>Ectoderm cells,</dt><dd> cells covering the outside of sponges and
some other animals. In sponges it is believed that endoderm
and ectoderm cells are able to exchange positions and
functions.</dd>

<dt><a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" id="Page_52" title="[Pg 52]"></a>
Mesoglea,</dt><dd> a jelly-like layer between the endoderm and
ectoderm layers. In the sponges this contains many wandering
cells, probably from the other layers.</dd>

<dt>Porifera <span class="noni">(pore bearers)</span>,</dt><dd> animals with many more or less
independent cells, supported by solid skeletal parts and
penetrated by a system of canals which open on the surface
as pores.</dd>
</dl>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Study a simple sponge to see the shape, size, and point
of attachment. Identify the osculum. In a diagram of a
long section of a simple sponge identify the central cavity,
body walls, canals, inhalent pores, ostia, and osculum. In
a simple sponge cut like the diagram identify the same
structures. Do the same for the toilet sponge.</p>

<p>Study a diagram of a portion of the body wall, considerably
enlarged. Identify the endoderm and ectoderm cells,
the spicules or fibers, and, among the spicules or fibers,
irregular am&oelig;boid cells, sometimes called mesoderm cells.</p>

<p>Examine a fragment or section of each kind of sponge
under the microscope. Notice the arrangement, shape,
and length of the spicules and of the fibers.</p>

<p>Test both kinds of sponges by dropping a bit of each
into weak acid, and noting the results. Also burn a bit of
each and notice the odor.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>What is the shape of a simple sponge? What enables
a mass of cells to retain such a definite shape?</li>

<li>What seems to be the composition of the skeletons?
Why is one type of skeleton rigid and the other elastic?</li>

<li>Since sponges are attached for most of their lives to
stationary objects, suggest means for obtaining food and
oxygen, and for getting rid of waste matter.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" id="Page_53" title="[Pg 53]"></a>
Although individual cells are sensitive, a sponge as a
whole is not. What connection has this fact with the fact
that sponges are stationary?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">Compare simple and complex sponges.</li>
</ol>

<li><span>A few spicules.</span></li>
<li><span>A few fibers.</span></li>
</ol>

<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Living hydras in permanent aquaria, undisturbed. Living
hydras in small aquaria, <i>i.e.</i> tumblers, test tubes, watch
glasses, etc., with pieces of water weed and if possible some
of the microscopic animals found in water where hydras
are abundant. If kept cool, hydras may live several days
in such aquaria. Permanent slides of hydras; some whole,
some in sections, and some showing the organs of reproduction.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" id="Page_55" title="[Pg 55]"></a></p>


<h6>Definitions.</h6>

</dl>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Take a small aquarium to your table, set it down carefully
and leave it undisturbed. Identify a hydra and
watch it for some time.</p>


<h6>Observations on the living animals.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Describe the size and shape of a hydra when expanded.
Disturb it slightly by shaking the aquarium a little, and describe
its shape when contracted. Notice also the flexibility
of the body. What do you infer concerning the
hydra's possession of a skeleton? What advantage can it
be to have a body so flexible?</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" id="Page_56" title="[Pg 56]"></a>
How many tentacles has the hydra that you are studying?
What does the hydra do with these tentacles when
it is expanded? What is the probable object of such
actions?</li>

<li>How does a hydra respond to contact? What seems
to be the object of such a response?</li>

<li>Notice the location of the hydras in the large, undisturbed
aquaria. Where are they placed as regards the
light side of the aquarium? Of what value is such a response
to light in their case?</li>

<li>How can a hydra locate the small animals which are
its food?

<p class="blockquot">How can it capture them?</p></li>

<li>What motions may a hydra perform, while remaining
attached by its base? What are the results of these movements?</li>

<li>If you have happened to see a hydra move from one
place to another, describe the process. If not, give the facts
which lead you to believe that it is able to do so. Suggest
all the methods you think it may be able to use. What is
your opinion of the hydra's power of locomotion? Of what
use is it in getting food; in escaping enemies; in following
the fluctuations of the water supply? If you had to class
the hydra as either one, would you call it a stationary or a
locomotory animal?</li>

<li>Study budding hydras. Compare the bud with the
parent hydra as to size, form and number and size of tentacles.
Notice whether the bud moves independently or
only with the parent. When does it separate from the
parent?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">In hydras collected late in the fall you may see another method
of reproduction. If such material is at hand, notice small swellings
near the proximal end and others near the tentacles. Eggs are produced<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" id="Page_57" title="[Pg 57]"></a>
in the lower one, the ovary, and sperm cells in the upper one,
the spermary. Refer to your text-book for further details.</li>
</ol>


<h6>Details of structure.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Using an entire mounted specimen and a section of
hydra, identify the body wall and the central cavity. What
is the extent of the central cavity? (Examine both the

<p>Living earthworms, some of which are left undisturbed
from day to day, in damp earth with leaves of various
plants scattered upon it.</p>


<h6>Definitions.</h6>

<dl>
<dt>Anterior end,</dt><dd> the head end, usually the leading end.</dd>

<dt>Posterior end,</dt><dd> the end opposite the anterior end.</dd>

<dt>Ventral surface,</dt><dd> the lower surface, usually the one which
contains the mouth.</dd>

<dt>Dorsal surface,</dt><dd> the one opposite the ventral surface.</dd>

<dt>Somites,</dt><dd> the rings or segments of which some animal
bodies are composed.</dd>

<dt>Bilateral symmetry,</dt><dd> the symmetry usually shown by animals
which have differentiated dorsal and ventral surfaces,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" id="Page_62" title="[Pg 62]"></a>
and right and left sides. Animals which do not have such
differentiated surfaces are usually <i>radially symmetrical</i>,
but sometimes asymmetrical (without symmetry).</dd>

<dt>Girdle,</dt><dd> the somewhat transparent band frequently found
near the anterior end of an earthworm.</dd>

<dt>Anal opening,</dt><dd> the posterior opening of the food canal.</dd>

<dt>Setæ <span class="noni">(singular form, <i>seta</i>)</span>,</dt><dd> small bristles or stiff hairs.
In the earthworm these are set in the body wall at definite
intervals, and aid in locomotion.</dd>

<dt>Cuticle,</dt><dd> in the earthworm a delicate, shining cover over
the body.</dd>

<dt>Egg capsules,</dt><dd> small, light-colored, spindle-shaped sacks,
about the size and somewhat the shape of a grain of wheat,
containing the eggs or young of earthworms.</dd>
</dl>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Take a living earthworm to your table and keep it damp
by placing it in a wet tray or upon moist paper. Identify
the anterior and posterior ends, the dorsal and ventral surfaces,
and the right and left sides. Identify also the somites
and the girdle, the mouth with its projecting lip, and the
anal opening.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Watch a living worm for some time. Does it seem to
have a definite object in its moving?  If so, what is it?
Upon what sense or senses does it seem to depend for
guidance? Which end usually leads? Why?</li>

<li>Over what sort of surface does it move most easily?
Why? Watch it closely for some time and discover how it
is able to move from place to place. (<i>Suggestion.</i> What
is the function of the setæ in this process?  How can you
explain the alternate contraction and expansion of parts?)</li>

<li>From time to time, for perhaps a week, examine the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" id="Page_63" title="[Pg 63]"></a>
leaves which were scattered where the worms could reach
them. Have the worms moved them about at all? If so,
where are the leaves left? Have any been eaten, in part
or entirely? If so, is there any evidence of selection, either
as to the kind of leaf or the portion of leaf eaten? If earthworms
select food, what senses would be useful for the purpose?
Have you any evidence that earthworms possess
such senses?</li>

<li>Looking through the dorsal wall, notice the meandering
red line, seen more easily in some regions than in others.
This is the dorsal blood vessel. How long is it? Where
is it wider? Where narrower? Notice its pulsations.
How many times per minute does it pulsate? In which
direction is the blood forced? Is there a corresponding ventral
blood vessel? Place a small worm between two pieces
of glass, so that you may see through it more easily, and
identify the blood vessels encircling the digestive canal,
near the anterior end. These are the so-called "hearts"
of the earthworm. If possible, decide in which direction
the blood flows through them.</li>

<li>The food canal, or alimentary canal, lies underneath
the dorsal blood vessel, and is usually easily seen, especially
if it is full of food. Notice it when the worm is fully
stretched and again when it is contracted. How long is
the canal? Why does it wrinkle when the worm contracts?
Where does it open to the outside? Why does it need to?</li>

<li>Where do you infer respiration must take place in this
animal? Why do you think so? What fits this surface for
such a purpose?  Why does an earthworm seem so uncomfortable
when it is too dry?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">Where do earthworms live? What conditions are necessary in
their habitat?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">When do earthworms usually leave their burrows? Why at that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" id="Page_64" title="[Pg 64]"></a>

</dl>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Select a large worm and cut carefully through the body
wall along one side, midway between the dorsal and ventral
surfaces, from the anterior end to the posterior. Lay the
worm on any convenient fairly soft surface (a piece of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" id="Page_66" title="[Pg 66]"></a>
pine, cork, peat, paraffin), preferably under water, and pin
out the walls so that you can see into the interior.</p>

<p>Identify the structures defined above, as well as the
dorsal and ventral blood vessels and the "hearts."</p>

<p>The nephridia are not easily distinguished, though they
are very numerous. They are long, slender, coiled tubes,
two in each somite, lying in the body cavity, one on each
side of the alimentary canal. If possible, identify them.</p>

<p>Notice that most of the internal organs are free from
the body wall, lying free in the body cavity.</p>

and dorso-ventral, longitudinal ones.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" id="Page_67" title="[Pg 67]"></a></p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>In a section under a simple lens, identify the dorsal
and ventral surfaces, the body wall, the body cavity, the
alimentary canal, and, if possible, the dorsal and ventral
blood vessels and the ventral nerve cord.</p>

<p>Under a microscope identify the same structures.
Notice that the body wall consists of three layers of cells:
an outer single layer, the <em>epidermis</em>; a middle layer, the
<em>circular muscles</em>; and an inner one, the <em>longitudinal
muscles</em>.</p>

<p>The nephridia show as loosely scattered fragments in
the body cavity, at the right and left of the alimentary
canal.</p>

<p>If you happen to have a section which shows one or
more setæ, identify the muscles which operate it, and the
group of glandular cells at its inner end, which are known
as <em>setigerous</em> (from <em>seta</em>) cells.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Describe the epidermal cells. What is their probable
function? Among them notice larger cells, clear and
rounded. These are the <em>mucous</em> (slime) cells.

<p class="blockquot">What is the use of mucus to the worm?</p></li>

<li>Describe the muscle cells. In which direction do the
muscle fibers extend? What is their function? Which
layer of muscle cells is thicker, the circular or the longitudinal?
Why should it be?</li>

<li>Notice the cells in the walls of the alimentary canal.
What layers do you find? How are they arranged?</li>

<li>If the section you are studying is a cross section from
the region back of the gizzard, the alimentary canal will
look horseshoe shaped, indented from the dorsal surface.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" id="Page_68" title="[Pg 68]"></a>
What is the effect of this indentation upon the amount of
surface in the alimentary canal?</li>

<h3>A Study of Crustacea</h3>

<p class="secdesc">To Show the General Adaptation of an Invertebrate to its
Surroundings</p>


<h4>1. A STUDY OF CRAYFISHES</h4>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Crayfishes, living and preserved. Some of the living
crayfishes should be established in conditions as natural
as possible <i>i.e.</i> in an inch or so of fresh water, with rocks,
weeds, etc., and left undisturbed. Small crayfishes are
desirable to show locomotion in water.</p>


<h5><a name="LIVING_CRAYFISH" id="LIVING_CRAYFISH"></a>Living Crayfishes</h5>


<h6>Directions and observations.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Observe living crayfishes in their usual habitat or
in a large aquarium, without disturbing them, and see
where they stay when they are free to choose. Notice
their position. What senses are on guard? What is
the color of the head and claws? How may this color
aid the animal in getting food or in escaping enemies?
Why is the color of the posterior region less important
than the color of the anterior?</li>

<li>Offer them bits of meat. If one takes food, notice
the appendages it uses. How does it discover the food?<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" id="Page_74" title="[Pg 74]"></a>
With what appendages does it grasp the food? How is
the food conveyed to the mouth? With what senses, if
any, does the animal test the food as it eats it?</li>

<li>If the crayfishes are in plenty of water and you
startle them in any way, some of them may swim. Watch
for such an occurrence and notice it carefully. How is
swimming accomplished? Which end leads in swimming?
How far does the animal swim at a stroke? How long
does it continue to swim? Where does it go? Does it
see where it is going? For what purpose would this
method of locomotion be useful?</li>

<li>Place a living crayfish in a tray with water to cover
it, and take it to your table. Watch the crayfish as it
walks about in the water, then take it out and let it walk
out of water. Compare the two processes. What causes
the differences?</li>

<li>How many appendages are used in walking? What
order, if any, is there in moving the legs? Which method,
walking or swimming, does it use in going to some particular
spot, <i>e.g.</i> in going to find food or cover? Why?</li>

<li>Gently turn the animal on its back and watch the
movements of its appendages as it rights itself. Which
appendages does it use and how does it use them? How
can it manage to use so many appendages in harmony,
for one result?</li>

<li>For what different purposes have you seen the crayfishes
use their large claws? For which does the claw
seem best fitted? Can you think of any change which
would make it more efficient for its main purpose? If
so, describe the change and tell how it would work.</li>

<li>Test the distribution of the sense of feeling. Is it
anywhere especially acute? If so, where? Why have
two pairs of feelers? Where is each pair carried when<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" id="Page_75" title="[Pg 75]"></a>
the animal is at rest; when it is in motion? How much
territory can the two pairs guard?</li>

<li>Touch the eyes. Compare their sensitiveness with
that of your own eyes. What movements can the eyes
perform? How are they protected? What range of territory
can they guard?</li>

<li>What other senses, if any, do you think a crayfish
has? Why do you think so?</li>

<li>Early in the spring crayfishes may be found carrying
eggs or young. If such a specimen is at hand, notice
where and how the eggs or young are attached. How
many are there? How are they cared for? Can the
young crayfish let go? If removed, can they attach themselves
again? How much care does the mother give
them when they are removed?</li>

Appendages,</dt><dd> paired structures attached to the body.
They are named as follows:&mdash;

<li>The anal opening, in the last segment of the abdomen.</li>

<li>The opening from the reproductive gland, toward

</ul></dd>
</dl>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<ol>
<li>How large is your specimen? How does it compare
in size with other crayfishes in the laboratory?</li>

<li>Describe the shape of the body, contrasting the anterior
end with the posterior, and the dorsal surface with the
ventral.</li>

<li>Study the amount of motion permitted in different
parts of the body. What prevents motion? What permits<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" id="Page_77" title="[Pg 77]"></a>
it? Where is the body most flexible? Why?
Where is it most rigid? Why?</li>

<li>How much of the surface is covered with exoskeleton?
What arrangement is there to permit the animal to
feel contact?

<p class="blockquot">How can the animal grow with such an exoskeleton?</p></li>

<li>Place a dead crayfish in dilute acid for a few hours.
What is the result? What has the acid done? Explain
the fact that crayfishes are often found alive and well with
a soft shell?</li>

<li>Compare the cephalo-thorax with the abdomen as to
size, shape, and flexibility.</li>

<li>How many somites are there in the abdomen?
Which way does it bend? Study the somite shells on
every side and then state what there is in their construction
which determines the direction and amount of their
motion. How are the somite shells arranged to protect
the body during bending? How is the ventral surface of
the abdomen protected?</li>

<li>Where are the appendages attached? Study a walking
leg and describe its general construction, the number
and kind of joints, the direction of motion in each joint,
and the range of motion for the whole leg. Study an
antenna in the same way. What methods are used in the
crayfish to secure a wide range of motion? To secure
flexibility?</li>

<li>Carefully split a crayfish into right and left halves.
To do this, first cut through the ventral exoskeleton from
end to end with scissors, then with a sharp knife or razor
cut through to the dorsal exoskeleton and cut that with the
scissors. Study one half, to get a better idea of the
attachment of the appendages. These may then be removed<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" id="Page_78" title="[Pg 78]"></a>
and placed in order on a piece of paper upon which
a list of the appendages has been written.</li>

<li>How many pairs of appendages are there? How
may they be grouped according to location; how grouped
according to function? How many pairs are there in each
group?</li>

<li>What similarities of structure do you find in nearly
all of the appendages? Assuming a swimmeret of the
third, fourth, or fifth somite to be the least changed from
the primitive type, what changes were necessary to make
the sixth swimmeret; the third maxilliped; the walking
legs; the antennæ; the antennules?</li>

<li>Remove the part of the carapace which covers a
gill chamber. What are the boundaries of the chamber?
Where does it open to the water?</li>

<li>Describe the appearance and the texture of a gill.
How are the gills kept moist when the crayfish is in
water; when it is on land? Why should they be kept
moist?</li>

<li>Would you class the gills as external structures or
as internal? Why do you think so? To what are they
attached? How are the gills affected by the motion of
the legs?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">What work goes on in the gills? How is the supply of oxygen
renewed? In this connection, try a live crayfish, kept quiet in water
just about deep enough to cover it. Float bits of paper near it or
carefully place a drop of ink in the water near it. By some such method
currents of water may usually be shown, and their direction determined.
Consider also the habitual motions of mouth parts and swimmerets, the
bubbles sometimes seen when a crayfish is dropped into water and the
habit crayfishes have of lying on one side, close to the surface of the
water.</li>

<h4><a name="CLAM" id="CLAM"></a>1. THE CLAM&mdash;A TYPE OF MOLLUSCA</h4>

<p class="secdesc">To Show the Effect of a Heavy Exoskeleton</p>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Living clams in aquaria, with enough moist sand to
cover the clams, preserved clams, sets of matched clamshells,
a few shells with the hinge unbroken, evaporating
dishes, hydrochloric acid.</p>


<h6>Definitions.</h6>

<dl>
<dt>Mollusca,</dt><dd> a branch of the animal kingdom including
those animals with soft, unsegmented bodies, inclosed in
two folds of skin known as the mantle. They are often
called shellfish as most of the forms have a shell.</dd>

<dt>Lamellibranchiata <span class="noni">or</span> Pelecypoda,</dt><dd> names given to the class
of Mollusca to which the clam belongs. The former term
refers to the broad, flap-like gills and the latter to the
hatchet-like foot.</dd>

<dt>Valve,</dt><dd> one of two parts of the clamshell.</dd>

<dt>Hinge ligament,</dt><dd> the elastic structure which fastens the
valves together at the dorsal margin.</dd>

<dt>Umbones,</dt><dd> a pair of elevations near the anterior end of
the shell.</dd>

<dt><a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" id="Page_84" title="[Pg 84]"></a>
Lines of growth,</dt><dd> concentric lines around the umbones.</dd>

<dt>Siphons,</dt><dd> two openings at the posterior end of the clam,
the upper opening is the <i>excurrent</i> opening and the lower
the <i>incurrent</i>. In the salt water clam the siphons form a
long tube, usually called the "neck."</dd>

<dt>Hinge teeth,</dt><dd> projections near the dorsal margin on the
inner surface of the shell. The anterior irregular structure
is the <i>cardinal</i> and the more posterior blade-like structure
is the <i>lateral</i> tooth.</dd>

<dt>Muscle scars,</dt><dd> scar-like markings on the inner surface of
the shell indicating the point where muscles were attached.
The large scar just in front of the cardinal tooth is the
<i>anterior adductor muscle scar</i>, and the one just back of the
lateral tooth is the <i>posterior adductor muscle scar</i>.</dd>

<dt>Pallial line,</dt><dd> a line connecting the two muscle scars.</dd>

<dt>Mantle,</dt><dd> folds of skin covering the body of the clam and
lying close to the inner surface of the valves.</dd>

<dt>Foot,</dt><dd> a hatchet-shaped structure extending from the ventral
edge of the body.</dd>

<dt>Gills,</dt><dd> broad flap-like structures for respiration, situated
each side of the body in the mantle cavity. They consist
of a double fold of membrane through which run many
perforations lined with cilia. The waving of these cilia
cause the current of water needed for respiration.</dd>

<dt>Palps,</dt><dd> small flap-like structures near the anterior end of
the clam. They surround the mouth. On their surface
are cilia which cause currents of water toward the mouth.</dd>

<dt>Adductor muscles,</dt><dd> large muscles extending from valve to
valve.</dd>
</dl>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>Identify anterior and posterior ends, dorsal and ventral
surfaces, right and left sides.</p>

<ol>
<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" id="Page_85" title="[Pg 85]"></a>
Why may a clam be called a bivalve?</li>

<li>What is the position of the clam in the mud? What
is the position of the foot if the clam is undisturbed?
Are the two valves tightly closed or slightly open at this
time?</li>

<li>What changes take place in the shell as the clam
grows? What markings on the surface of the shell indicate
this?</li>

<li>Where is the clam sensitive to touch or tactile stimulus?
Why has the clam no eyes? Zoölogists have found
a structure in clams which they have supposed to be an
ear. Where do you think the structure is located? Why
is the clam successful without eyes? (There are many
bivalves which have them.)</li>

<li>Examine several clams until you find some with enlargements
in the gills. Break off a small part of an
enlargement with your forceps and examine under the compound
microscope. Describe what you see.</li>

<li>Drop some powdered chalk or carmine in the water
just above the siphon, watch the siphons for several minutes,
and note what happens. What do you conclude to be
the use of the siphons? Recalling what took place in
sponges, what would you suggest as the probable cause of
these currents? What does the clam thus probably obtain?
How do the two siphons differ? Why?</li>

<li>Place a clam in water sufficient to cover it and heat
slowly to about 40 degrees Centigrade, until the valves
open slightly. Remove and proceed as follows: Raise one
valve, separate the mantle from it, and then cut through the
two large firm structures (adductor muscles) found at each
end. What does the valve do when the muscles are cut?
What is the cause of this? State your theory as to how a
clam opens and closes its shell.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" id="Page_86" title="[Pg 86]"></a>
Note the texture of the mantle. How many lobes
has it? What is their extent? How are the lobes related
to the valves?</li>

<li>Remove or lift up one mantle lobe. Identify the soft
body, the foot, the gills, the palps, and the mouth. Which
of these structures are arranged in pairs?</li>

<li>Determine the structure and composition of the shell
as follows:&mdash;
<ol class="alpha nested">
<li><span>Break a thick clamshell and examine the broken
edge. Identify the inner or pearly layer and the outer or
chalky layers. What gives color to the shell in the living
clam?</span></li>

<li><span>Burn a small piece of shell in an evaporating dish
over a bunsen burner. What is the appearance of the
shell after burning? What has been burned, animal or
mineral matter? What then is the residue?</span></li>

<li><span>Place a small piece of shell in acid. What results?
Is there a large amount of residue? What constitutes the
greater part of the shell, animal or mineral matter?</span></li>

<li><span>(Optional) Devise some method and determine the
approximate per cent of mineral and of animal matter in
the clamshell.</span></li>

a lens. What do you notice? If your aquarium in which
the pond snail is living has a green coating (algæ) on the
side, describe its appearance after the snail has been crawling
up and down over it. Explain.</li>

<li>How many tentacles has a pond snail? a land
snail? Where are the eyes located in each case? What
movements of the tentacles do you notice? What is their
purpose?</li>

<li>How does the rate of locomotion of the snail compare
with that of the clam? Find out if the snail can creep
backwards or on the surface of the water. Does there
seem to be any tendency for the snail to go up and down
the sides of the aquaria vertically rather than to the right
or left?</li>

<li>What does a snail do when disturbed? What is
gained by this action?</li>

<li>Search for pond snail's eggs on the side of the aquaria.
Lift up the bits of cabbage on which the slugs are feeding
and search for eggs. Describe what you find in each case,
noting the size, appearance, and whether the eggs are laid
singly or in masses.</li>

<li>Find the breathing pore. Describe its position and
appearance.</li>

<li>Contrast the various types of shells, and note with
care in what respects they differ. Holding the shell with
the aperture toward you and the spire pointing up, determine
whether each shell has the aperture on the right
(right-handed shell) or on the left (left-handed shell).
Is the right-handed or the left-handed shell more common?</li>

<li>(Optional) By means of some book in the laboratory,
determine the scientific name of each of the snails found
in the various aquaria in the laboratory.</li>

<h5><a name="EXTERNAL_STRUCTURE" id="EXTERNAL_STRUCTURE"></a>The External Structure of the Fish</h5>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Freshly killed or preserved fish in dishes or shallow
pans with enough water to prevent drying. Simple or
compound microscopes, forceps, and a bristle.</p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Examine the fins and identify the membrane and the
supporting rods, or <i>rays</i>, of bone or cartilage. Notice<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" id="Page_104" title="[Pg 104]"></a>
how the ends of the cartilaginous rays keep the membrane
from tearing.</p>

<p>Investigate the scales as to their arrangement, number,
and size. Remove a small patch of scales along the
lateral line to find how they are attached, where the fish's
color is situated, and how access to the sensory organs of
the line is permitted. Examine a scale under the microscope.</p>

<p>Observe the eyes and identify the parts similar to those
of the human eye: lid, lash, tear-duct, cornea, iris, and
pupil.</p>

<p>In front of and between the eyes, find the nostrils. By
means of a bristle determine whether these are connected
and whether they do or do not open into the mouth or
the throat.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Make a list of the fins, classifying them according to
their structure.</li>

<li>Bearing in mind the differences in structure and
consequent action,&mdash;what can you say regarding the
adaptation of the several fins for protection? for rigidity
or flexibility in locomotion?</li>

<li>State how much of the body is covered with scales,
and where the largest and the smallest ones are found.</li>

<li>How are the scales arranged with reference to each
other? What benefit is derived from this in protection?
in locomotion? If you have noticed any mucus or slime
upon the body, state its use.</li>

<li>Do the scales or the skin bear the pigment? Give
the color pattern of the kind of fish used in class. How
would this be useful to the fish in its natural home?</li>

<li>Describe the structure of a scale and state how it is<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" id="Page_105" title="[Pg 105]"></a>
attached to the skin. In what way is the lateral-line scale
specialized?</li>

<li>State how, when the fish is swimming, the nostrils
catch odors. By means of a diagram, with arrows show
the probable direction of the water current through the
nose.</li>

<li>State which of the structures of your eye are present
in the fish's eye, and which are missing. Could a fish
weep? wink? How would a fish sleep?</li>

<li>Inasmuch as light penetrates water but a little way, so that
objects can be distinguished only within about thirty feet, would the
fish be nearsighted or farsighted?</li>
</ol>

exercise may be used here.</p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>The mouth, its structure and its action, can be seen by
pulling the upper jaw upward and forward until the mouth
and the gill chambers open fully. Examine the structure
and action of the jaws, the tongue, the throat, and the
teeth on each jaw and on the roof of the mouth.</p>

<p>Investigate the breathing apparatus from the throat side
and from the exterior, noting the number, form, and structure
of the gills, their attachment and their protection.</p>

<h5><a name="ALIMENTARY_CANAL_AND_CIRCULATORY_SYSTEM" id="ALIMENTARY_CANAL_AND_CIRCULATORY_SYSTEM"></a>The Alimentary Canal and the Circulatory System of the Fish</h5>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Small fresh fish, shallow pans or dishes of water, forceps,
and scissors.</p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>If the instructor has not opened the fish previously, this
is to be done by the student as follows: On the ventral
side, insert the scissors in the vent (in front of the anal fin)
and cut straight forward to a point between the opercula.
Care must be exercised in opening the chamber about the
heart; this lies between the gill chambers.</p>

<p>The various organs, so far as possible, should be carefully
drawn out and separated, in order that their structure may
be distinguished.</p>

<p>The pupil should identify the following parts:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><a name="ref_pericardial_chamber" id="ref_pericardial_chamber"></a><i>Body cavity</i>, the entire internal space, divided by a
membrane, <i>false diaphragm</i>, into a large <i>abdominal cavity</i><a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" id="Page_108" title="[Pg 108]"></a>
and a small chamber, <i>pericardial chamber</i>, between the
gill chambers.</li>

<li><i>Liver</i>, a large red or pink mass lying at the front
end of the abdominal cavity, and divided into two unequal
lobes. The <i>gall-bladder</i>, thin-walled and green, may be
seen between these lobes.</li>

<li><i>Alimentary canal</i>.

<ol class="alpha nested">
<li><span><i>Mouth.</i></span></li>

<li><span><i>Esophagus</i>, in the fish a very short tube.</span></li>

<li><span><i>Stomach</i>, white and muscular, beginning with
a very short esophagus and ending as a blind sac.
If it is much distended, open it to see what the fish
may have eaten.</span></li>

<li><span><i>Small intestine</i>, thin-walled, tubular, and somewhat
coiled.</span></li>

<li><span><i>Large intestine</i>, a short, thin-walled expansion
at the posterior end of the small intestine; usually
less than half an inch long.</span></li>

<li><span><i>C&oelig;ca</i>, from two to several small pouches
attached where the small intestine leaves the
stomach.</span></li>
</ol></li>

<li><i>Spleen</i>, a reddish brown <i>globule</i> between the folds of
the intestine.</li>

<li><i>Swim bladder</i>, an elongated chamber lying against
the backbone, partitioned off from the cavity below by a
delicate membrane.</li>

<li><i>Peritoneum</i>, the delicate, silvery membrane which
lines the abdominal cavity and enfolds the viscera. Note
its spots of pigment.</li>

<li><i>Pericardial chamber</i>, the chamber around the heart;
see <a href="#ref_pericardial_chamber">§ 1</a> above.</li>

<li><i>Heart.</i> As the fish is placed belly upward in the pan
the <i>ventricle</i> faces you, pink, conical, and muscular.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" id="Page_109" title="[Pg 109]"></a>
Posterior to it, on the dorsal side, is the <i>auricle</i>, a membranous
sac.</li>

<li><i>Ventral aorta</i>, arising on the anterior surface of the
ventricle as a white muscular "cord" (really a tube) which
is enlarged close to the heart into a bulb, the <i>arterial bulb</i>.
You should follow up this aorta until you see it divide
right and left to send its branches outward into the gills,
the branches being called <i>gill arteries</i>.</li>
</ol>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>The fish frequently swallows its food alive. Why
should the stomach be muscular? Why is it better that
the intestine does not leave the stomach at the end opposite
the esophagus?</li>

<li>Of what use can the c&oelig;ca be? What structure of
the human intestine do you recall that is at all like them
in form or use?</li>

<li>How many times the length of the body is the length
of the alimentary canal? Does this indicate that the fish
is compelled to eat a great deal of poor food or that its
food is highly nutritious, so that little need be taken?</li>

<li>Near which end of the fish's body is the heart? Is
this the usual or the unusual condition among animals you
know about? What advantages can you think of in this
arrangement?</li>

<li>What advantages are there in having the heart in a
chamber separated from the other vital organs?</li>

<li>Of how many chambers does the heart consist? Why
should at least one of them be muscular?</li>

<li>How many times does the blood pass through the
heart in making a complete circuit of the body? Would
you call this a single or a double circulation?</li>

<li>Does the heart force the blood onward or does it<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" id="Page_110" title="[Pg 110]"></a>
draw blood into itself, <i>i.e.</i> is the heart a force pump or is
it a suction pump?</li>

<li>How is circulation made complete? If the heart is a
force pump, is its power sufficient to drive blood through
artery, capillary, vein, and into auricle, if the capillaries
can stand the pressure, or is another action concerned? If
it is a suction pump, why does the blood leave the heart?</li>

<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>An acorn-tongued worm, a lancelet, a lamprey, a shark,
and a perch. If individual specimens are not available,
the pupil's text-book and charts are to be used.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<dl>
<dt>Acorn-tongued worm:</dt><dd> Notice the very simple form and
structure of the symmetrical body, the "proboscis," the
collar surrounding the neck with its simple rod of cartilage,
the marks of internal gills and gill slits extending some
distance along the body, and the presence or absence of
sense organs. The acorn-tongued worm (<i>Balanoglossus</i>)
lives in the sand of the seashore and in shallow water in
temperate and tropical regions.</dd>

<dt>Lancelet:</dt><dd> Observe the form of the body, of the fin, and
of the mouth; note the presence or absence of sense
organs, and find out the number of gills or gill slits. The
lancelet (<i>Amphioxus</i>) is similar in habit to the acorn-tongued
worm. By day it lies buried with only the
mouth exposed, but at night it swims actively about. It
is somewhat more confined to the tropics.</dd>

<dt>Lamprey:</dt><dd> Observe here also the primitive or unspecialized
form of the body, of the fin, of the jawless mouth,
the number of gill slits, and the sense organs.</dd>

<dt>Shark:</dt><dd> Examine the body, noting its form and differentiation<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" id="Page_113" title="[Pg 113]"></a>
into regions, its covering, its fins, mouth, gill
slits, and sense organs.</dd>

<dt>Perch:</dt><dd> If you have not already studied the bony fish,
the points suggested for the shark will be sufficient for
this exercise.</dd>

<li>How is protection afforded the delicate structure of
the gills in the final form?</li>

<li>Give the stages in the formation of a definite, symmetrical
mouth with jaws of equal size.</li>

earthworms, etc., before it. How does it seize the food?<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" id="Page_115" title="[Pg 115]"></a>
What will it eat? How is the mouth adapted to this
manner of feeding?</li>
</ol></dd>

<dt>Respiration.</dt>
<dd><ol class="resume5">
<li>The frog has no diaphragm, and therefore
no chest cavity; watch very carefully the movements
of the mouth, the nostrils, the throat, and the sides of the
body to determine how the problem of breathing (how
the air is gotten into and out of the lungs) without a
diaphragm is solved. Write a detailed account of the
frog's method of breathing which shall explain just how
the air is forced into the lungs.</li>

<li>What would be the effect of propping open the
mouth of the frog? Why? Does the frog breathe in
the usual manner while under the water? If not, how

<dt>Sense Organs.</dt>
<dd><ol class="resume7">
<li>Investigate the efficiency of the five
special senses in the frog by devising experiments to test
each sense; as, for example, giving a frog its liberty on
the floor and trying to catch it again, to test the sense
of sight. Write an account of your experiments and their
results. Which of the senses is best developed? Give
reasons for your answer.</li>

what respects different? Why should they differ?</li>

<li>Where are the frogs' ears located? What do you
think of the efficiency of an eardrum situated on the
surface of the body? Why?</li>

<li>The frog has certain other responses. Try turning
the jar or cage containing a frog around to face the
frog in another direction. What happens? How do you
explain this response on the basis of use? What other
responses have you noticed?</li>

front of the hind legs, and with the scissors cut straight
forward in the middle line until the floor of the mouth is
reached; this will separate the arms. Care must be taken
not to cut too deeply, but this may be avoided by keeping
the skin uplifted. Now cut sidewise in front of each hind
leg in order that the body wall may be laid aside. Under
the arms the heart will be seen; it will be studied as a part
of the circulatory system.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Identify the following organs:&mdash;</p>

<dl>
<dt>Liver,</dt><dd> the large red or brown mass, consisting of several
divisions and lying close up under the arms.</dd>

<dt>Bile sac,</dt><dd> small, green, and between the liver lobes.</dd>

<dt>Alimentary canal.</dt><dd>

<ol class="nested">
<li><i>Mouth.</i></li>

<li><i>Esophagus.</i></li>

<li><i>Stomach</i>, the elongated, light-colored, firm,
and muscular portion.</li>

<li><i>Small intestine</i>, a slender, more or less closely
coiled, tubular portion.</li>

<li><i>Large intestine</i>, a thin-walled enlargement at
the posterior end of the canal.</li>

<li><i>Duodenum.</i> This is a muscular portion of the
small intestine immediately following the stomach,
against which it is folded.</li>
</ol></dd>

<dt>Pancreas,</dt><dd> a yellowish, pulpy mass lying in the fold
between the stomach and the duodenum.</dd>

<dt>Spleen,</dt><dd> a dark red globule, usually smaller than a pea,
lying nearly free among the folds of the small intestine.</dd>

<dt>Fat bodies,</dt><dd> yellow fringe-like structures, sometimes found
near the stomach.</dd>

<dt><a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" id="Page_119" title="[Pg 119]"></a>
Kidneys,</dt><dd> a pair of elongated dark red organs, behind the
spleen and against the back. Note their numerous blood
vessels. Possibly the <i>ureters</i>, or urinal ducts, can be discovered
and traced to their junction with the <i>bladder</i>, a
clear membranous sac in the posterior extremity of the
body cavity.</dd>

<dt>Peritoneum,</dt><dd> a thin membrane lining the body cavity and
attaching the vital organs to the backbone.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Specimens secured in late fall, winter, or early spring may
contain, if female, a large number of dark-colored eggs; or if male, two
white testes, located near the kidneys and similar to them in form,

<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Name the parts of the frog's alimentary canal.</li>

<li>Name the glands or organs which are accessory
to the canal.</li>

<li>How long is the esophagus? How does the presence
or absence of a neck affect the esophagus?</li>

<li>How does the thickness of the stomach wall compare
with that of the intestine, and how do you account for the
difference?</li>

<li>Measure the length of the trunk of the frog's body
and that of the outstretched alimentary canal. How many
times the length of the one is that of the other? How
does this ratio compare with that of an herbivorous
animal?  (The sheep's food canal is about thirty-two
times the length of its body.)</li>

<li>What is the color of the bile, as seen through the
walls of the bile sac? This color is characteristic of carnivorous
animals; in herbivorous forms it is yellow. Find its
color in some omnivorous form, as man.</li>

<li>Name the organs concerned in excretion.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" id="Page_120" title="[Pg 120]"></a>
What holds the internal organs in place, and from
what are they suspended?</li>

<li>The spleen is called a "ductless gland." Give its
function, and explain why a duct is not necessary to it.</li>

<li>Since the frog swallows its food alive and entire,
what work must the stomach do? What digestive organs
would be absent from the mouth, or else poorly developed?</li>

<li>Since the frog is carnivorous, what digestive ferments
are probably present, and what ones absent from the alimentary
canal?</li>

<li>Fat bodies are largest in the fall, and are rarely
found in the spring. How can you account for this?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">When through with the general study of the alimentary canal,
you may open the stomach by cutting it lengthwise. Describe the
character of the stomach lining as to folds and villi, stating the advantage
of each being present and the reason for the direction of the folds. Tell
how the food is propelled onward through the alimentary canal. Give
the scientific name for this action.</li>

<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Of how many chambers does the frog's heart consist?
Name them, and describe them as to size, color, and structure.</li>

<li>Which chamber receives blood from the body, and
which receives blood from the lungs?</li>

<li>Name the large arteries and give the regions which
they supply. Name the large veins and give the regions
from which they come.</li>

<li>In the inflated lung, notice the interior partitions or
chambers, which are called <em>vesicles</em>. How do they affect
the amount of surface exposed for gas exchange in breathing?</li>

<li>Measuring the lung collapsed and again when inflated,
calculate its approximate volume in each case and state

<h6>Advanced questions.</h6>

<ol class="resume8">
<li class="bq_smaller">Apparently the pure and the impure blood must commingle upon
entering the single ventricle, but by a simple device this scarcely occurs.
How would such commingling affect the purity of the blood as
it reached the tissues, and hence affect waste removal, oxidation, body
temperature, activity, and intelligence?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">What are the chambers of the fish's heart? of the mammalian (human)
heart? How may the heart of the frog be regarded as intermediate
between these others? How and where might the growth of a
partition within it bring about the higher structure? (This actually occurs

<h5><a name="NERVOUS_SYSTEM" id="NERVOUS_SYSTEM"></a>The Nervous System of the Frog</h5>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Specimens which have the brain exposed and other
specimens whose viscera have been removed so that the
spinal nerves can be seen; pans or shallow dishes of water
and forceps.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>The nerve tissues are generally white in color unless
they have been specially treated and stained. The pupil
should identify the following structures:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A. Brain</i>, those enlargements of nerve tissue situated
in the head and composed of four principal parts, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Cerebral hemispheres</i>, a pair of elongated lobes, the
anterior enlargements.</li>

<li><i>Mid brain</i>, or <i>optic lobes</i>, a pair of large ovoid structures,
projecting diagonally forward and sidewise.</li>

<li><i>Cerebellum</i>, a slender, transverse ridge, close behind
the midbrain.</li>

<li><i>Medulla</i>, the anterior end of the spinal cord, widest
in front and containing a triangular depression.</li>
</ol>

<p class="blockquot">(Frequently a pair of smaller enlargements is to be seen in front of
the cerebral hemispheres; they are the <i>olfactory lobes</i>, and from them
nerves pass forward to the nasal chamber.)</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" id="Page_124" title="[Pg 124]"></a>
<i>B. Spinal cord</i>, extending along the spine, giving rise
to nerves.</p>

<p><i>C. Spinal nerves</i>, ten pairs of nerves which are connected
with the cord through dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor)
roots, and which penetrate the body and its appendages.
The first enters the neck; the second and third join and
enter the arm; the fourth to sixth penetrate the skin and
muscles of the trunk; the seventh to ninth join by a plexus
to form the sciatic nerve which supplies the leg, and the
tenth enters the posterior portion of the body.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Which lobes of the brain are paired? Give at least
two possible causes or reasons for their double structure.</li>

<li>The optic lobes are connected with the eyes. Compare
their size with that of the other parts. Of how much
use do you think they are to the frog?</li>

<li>If folds or convolutions in the surface of the cerebrum
indicate intelligence, thoughtfulness, or mind, what do you
infer as to the frog's mental condition and power to think?</li>

<li>Has the frog brain or "brains"? Explain.</li>

<li>Name several things done by an animal's brain.</li>

<li>Which of the spinal nerves are specially large? Why
should they be large?</li>

<li>What advantages are there in the frog's having a dorsal
nerve cord instead of a ventral one, as the earthworm has?

<p class="bq_smaller">What would be the effect of cutting or breaking the dorsal root of a
spinal nerve? the ventral root? the entire spinal cord? How do you
explain the convulsions of the brainless (beheaded) chicken or frog?</p></li>

<li class="bq_smaller">What kinds of impulses originate outside of the nerve center, and
what kinds in the center?</li>

<li class="bq_smaller">Sensations reach the cord and brain through the dorsal root of the
spinal nerve. What kinds of messages travel through the ventral root,
and in what direction do they go?</li>

<li>Examining the inside of the mouth, find the teeth.
Judging from their size and structure, of what use are
these teeth?</li>

<li>What advantages can you see in having the arms and
legs attached to girdles instead of having them fastened
directly to the vertebral column? How has their development
affected the shape of the trunk, as opposed to that
of the fish?</li>

<li>Make a comparison of the two girdles as to their attachment

<li>On the vertebræ notice any irregularities, prominences,
or roughenings. For what are such bones better
adapted than smooth bones would be?</li>

<ol>
<li>In what important ways does the body of the turtle
differ from those of the snake and lizard?</li>

<li>What methods of locomotion has the turtle? For
which method is it best fitted? How? Why are its movements
in water so much less clumsy than on land? (Compare
weight on land with weight in water.) Compare the
efficiency of the locomotion of a turtle with that of a lizard
and suggest a reason for the difference.</li>

<li>What do turtles eat while in the laboratory? Since
turtles have no teeth, how can they bite off their food?</li>

<li>What can you discover with respect to the respiration
of the turtle? Does it breathe when under water?</li>

<li>What sense organs has a turtle? Which appears to
be most highly developed? How do you know?</li>

<li>In what various ways is the turtle protected against
enemies? (You should state several.) Are you afraid of
a turtle? If so, why? Why does the turtle need more
protection than the snake or lizard?</li>

<li>Describe the color pattern of the turtle you are studying.
Is this arrangement of colors the same for others of
the same species?</li>

<li>Describe the arrangement of the epidermal plates of
the turtle's shell. Are the arrangement, number, and form
of plates the same for all turtles of this species? Compare
with the plates of other species. What variations do you
find?</li>

<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>The pupils should study the arrangement of the feathers
and their variations in form and size, and should identify
the following principal kinds:&mdash;</p>

<dl>
<dt>Contour feathers,</dt><dd> those feathers, generally broad, which

in the skin. Examine its internal structure.</dd>

<dt>Vane,</dt><dd> the broad expanded portion, the part ordinarily
seen on the bird.</dd>

<dt>Shaft,</dt><dd> the mid-rib of the vane.</dd>

<dt>Barbs,</dt><dd> the delicate outgrowths of the shaft making up
the vane.</dd>

<p class="secdesc">To illustrate Distribution</p>


<h5><a name="BIRDS_LABORATORY_EXERCISE" id="BIRDS_LABORATORY_EXERCISE"></a>Work in the Laboratory</h5>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Bird skins or mounted birds, at least one representative of
each order and, better still, of each family of the birds
which pass through or remain in your neighborhood; specimens
in a museum may also be used. Some guide to the
identification of birds, as Walter's "Wild Birds in City
Parks" or Reed's "Bird Guide." A good diagram of a
bird.</p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Your object here is to familiarize yourself with the appearance
of birds of different types, and with the terms
used in describing them. Study first a diagram of a bird
and learn the terms and their applications.</p>

<p>An important item in the description of a bird is its
length. This is obtained by measuring from the tip of
the beak, over the curve of the head, to the end of the tail.
This measures a curved line and gives a greater length for
a bird than the straight line you would naturally estimate.
Train your eye by watching house sparrows (so-called
English sparrows) and fixing their length as a unit. They
are called six inches long, and in the field other birds may
be measured by them. The robin is ten inches long, and
may be used to measure the larger birds.</p>

<p>In describing the colors of birds, great discussions often
arise because pupils do not use terms correctly. Consult
Chapman's "Birds of Eastern North America" for a color
key or chart, and train yourself to observe colors carefully
and name them correctly. You will find more colors among<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" id="Page_140" title="[Pg 140]"></a>
birds than are given there, but the chart will help you a
great deal.</p>

<p>Study in the laboratory as many birds as you can. Try
to get one of each order at least and, among the perching
birds, one of each family. The answers to the following
questions should be recorded upon the blank outlines of
birds, or else in the form of a table.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>How long is the bird?</li>

<li>What is the general color of the upper surface; of
the lower?</li>

<li>What are the markings or peculiarities of the head, if
there are any?</li>

<li>Note any peculiarities of the tail, as to shape, length,
or color, if there are any<a class="corr" name="TC_3" id="TC_3" title="?">.</a></li>

<li>If the wings are not like the back, note their color, and,
if there are wing bars, note their number and color.</li>

<li>What are the markings on the breast, if there are any?</li>

<li>Note any other markings, as rump spot, etc.</li>

<li>What sort of beak has the bird?</li>

<li>What sort of feet has it?</li>

<li>Identify the bird, using any key or guide you have.
Do not ask any one to help you until you have exhausted
your own resources.</li>
</ol>


<h5>Comparative Study of Birds</h5>

<ol>
<li>In what ways do the feet of birds vary? Give examples
to illustrate your answer. What are the principal
results of these variations?</li>

<li>In what ways do the beaks of birds vary? Give examples
of the variations and of the special uses of the
beaks.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" id="Page_141" title="[Pg 141]"></a>
How do water birds differ from land birds; flesh-eating
birds from seed eaters; insect-eating birds from
seed eaters; shore and swamp birds from land birds?</li>
</ol>


<h5><a name="BIRDS_FIELD_WORK" id="BIRDS_FIELD_WORK"></a>Work in the Field</h5>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>(1) Birds in the field, field or opera glasses, and bird
guides. (2) Some extra time, as field work is rather slow.
(3) Considerable energy, as birds rise early and may be
up and away before the usual hour for your appearance.</p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>The object of this work is to become acquainted with the
living bird, to learn not only its name, but also some of its
ways. You will need to spend time to do this, and as a
rule the more time you spend the more you will see.
Every time you go out after birds, <em>record at the time</em> every
kind of bird you see, so that at the end of the season you will
know not only when each kind of bird came, but also how
long it staid. When you see a new bird, record immediately
its colors, markings, actions, notes, and anything else
which may help you later to identify it. Do not trust to
memory nor to the inspiration of the classroom. After
weeks of observation, write the following summary.</p>


<h5>Summary of the Results of Field Study of Birds</h5>

<h5><a name="THE_HORSE" id="THE_HORSE"></a>The Horse</h5>

<p>The pupil is expected to study carefully the account of
Eohippus or Hyracotherium in his text or any other available
reference book, and to supplement that work and this
brief sketch with original observations upon horses on the
street, at a local store, or wherever possible or convenient.</p>

<p>From the early horses which migrated from North
America there arose in Asia and Africa the ass, famous in
the history of early civilization and still used in some
localities as beasts of burden or for the breeding of mules,
which are the crosses between ass and horse. There also
arose the zebra and the most primitive of modern horses,
Przewalskii's horse, a wild pony of western China, about
forty inches high and almost identical with the drawings of
the horse made by early man, 30,000 years ago. Doubtless
the modern ponies of Ireland, Iceland, and Shetland are descendants
of the original Przewalskii type and not, as is
often claimed, true horses stunted by rigors of climate and
scant fare.</p>

<p>The horse is characterized largely by the presence of a
lock of hair between the ears, a full mane and tail, small
ears, large hoofs, and peculiar neigh. The ass has no forelock,
a scanty mane and tail, long ears, small hoofs, and a
distinct bray.</p>

<p>By means of various crusades and raids, the modern
horse was introduced into Europe from Asia, where it is<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" id="Page_163" title="[Pg 163]"></a>
clearly traced in history to the reign of King Solomon.
Here, in Europe, because of local conditions and demands,
it assumed differing type forms. The roadster type is
closest to the Arabian in character. The draft or heavy
type was bred in western Europe when heavy armor came
into use for rider and horse, and the coach or carriage type
was developed when armor was abandoned for gunpowder.
Finally explorers and colonists brought the horse back to
America, its original home.</p>

<p>The various types and varieties may be briefly described.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The draft type has short legs, short neck, large round
body, and ranges in weight from 1400 pounds to 2000
pounds.</p>

<p class="italic">Varieties:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Percheron:</i> generally about 1700 pounds in weight,
16 hands (64 inches) high, gray or black, blocky body, steep
rump, clean legs, and quick action.</li>

<li><i>Shire:</i> generally about 1800 pounds in weight, 17 hands
high, bay or brown, white marked feet and face, hairy
legs and feet, and slow action.</li>

<li><i>Belgian:</i> generally about 1800 pounds in weight,
16 hands high, chestnut or roan in color, compact body,
short, steep rump, and small feet.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>B.</i> The coach or carriage type has legs and neck of
medium length, a body full-chested but not blocky, and a
weight varying from 1150 pounds to 1400 pounds.</p>

<p class="italic">Varieties:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Hackney:</i> generally of full, broad, powerful body,
short legs and back, high action and high carriage of neck
and head, bay or chestnut in color, 15 hands high, and
1400 pounds in weight.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" id="Page_164" title="[Pg 164]"></a>
<i>Coach:</i> generally lighter than the Hackney, with
longer legs and long stride; height, 16 hands; weight,
1300 pounds.</li>

<li><i>Cleveland bay:</i> averaging 16&frac12; hands in height,
1350 pounds in weight, high, broad hips, strong action, and
bay color.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>C.</i> The roadster type is long and lean of limb and
body, and averages about 1100 pounds in weight.</p>

<p class="italic">Varieties:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Thoroughbred:</i> of small head, long neck, level back,
of variable color, 14&frac12;&ndash;16&frac12; hands high, about 1000 pounds
in weight.</li>

<li><i>American saddle:</i> an American production; not a
distinct breed, but a roadster of high quality.</li>

<li><i>American trotter:</i> a superior type of good speed.
The off forefoot and the nigh hind foot act together, the
nigh fore and the off hind feet together, giving a two-beat
gait.</li>

<li><i>Pacer:</i> similar to the trotter, but using both off feet
and both nigh feet together, giving a swinging gait.</li>
</ol>

<p>The horse is very similar to man in its physical and
mental character, being subject to the same ailments and
treatment and having the same impulses of affection,
hatred, fear, jealousy, obedience, willfulness, memory,
and perhaps reason. It is of all animals most careful in
its eating and drinking; because its stomach is small,
the food should not be bulky but concentrated, grain
forming a goodly portion of the ration.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important point in the structure of
the horse is the form of the leg and foot. The shoulder
should slope slightly backward and the pastern joint, immediately
above the hoof, slightly backward. The hips, or<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" id="Page_165" title="[Pg 165]"></a>
"quarters," should slope downward somewhat, and the hock
should be comparatively wide to afford ample leverage
for the pulling muscles. The legs should be straight
as pillars when seen from front or rear. The outer walls
of the hoof support most of the weight though the frog
should normally touch the ground. In nature the hoof
wears away properly of itself, but the <a class="corr" name="TC_6" id="TC_6" title="shed">shod</a> hoof needs
regular trimming attention, while the frog must not be
trimmed, for it is the soft growing part that nourishes
the hoof. In this treatment the foot is comparable with
the human finger and finger nail.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>If access to a living animal is impossible or inconvenient,
the pupil may use reference book or pictures
for most of these points. A measuring tape or ruler
should be at hand, and the assistance of an experienced
person is a valuable aid. If several horses are studied,
they should be distinguished by name or number.</p>

<p>Record the color, condition, weight, and height of the
horse at the shoulder. (Height is given in "hands," a
hand being the breadth of the palm, or 4 inches.) Note
the slope of the shoulder, of the back and the hips,
the general form of the head and neck, and the facial
expression. Find the chestnuts, warty growths on the
inside of each leg. Examine the foot, finding the V-shaped
frog in the center, surrounded by the horny hoof.</p>

<p>Find the pulse by passing the fingers downward from
the upper curve of the neck, along the inside of the jaw;
count the pulse. Notice the position and motion of the
ears with their lining of hair, and the position of the
eyes, the form of the pupil, and the probable range of
vision. Watch the horse use its lips, and examine the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" id="Page_166" title="[Pg 166]"></a>
mouth and teeth, finding the grinding teeth far back in
the mouth, the incisors in front, and the space where
the canines are missing.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The male may have canines in the upper jaw.</p>

<p>On the surfaces of the incisors are the depressions,
or "cups," by means of which age is determined.</p>

<p class="blockquot">At six years the cups leave the lower center teeth; at seven the
adjoining teeth; and at eight, the outer lower teeth. At nine years
they leave the upper center incisors; at ten, the adjoining teeth; and
at eleven, the outer teeth above. At the age of ten years a spot appears
in the outer upper incisors, at fifteen years the groove has worn to the
center of the tooth, and at twenty-one years the groove is worn to the
bottom of the tooth.</p>

another mammal, and man. If any of these be lacking,
lantern-slide illustrations may be used in a partially darkened
room.</p>


<h6>Observations.</h6>

<p>Having studied the frog's skeleton in detail, the student
can readily compare each of these types with it. Compare
in a very general way the skulls, the girdles, and the limbs;
their form and use. Note variations in the form and number
of the vertebræ and the number of the ribs.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>In which types of vertebrates are the joints between
the skull bones bound with cartilage?  How does the
joining change in later types?</li>

<li>What dissimilarities occur in the series as regards
closure or boxing in of the eye orbits, nostrils, and skull
bones? How would these changes in joining and closure
affect strength, rigidity, and protection?</li>

<li>What evidence is there that such improvement has
affected brain capacity and intelligence?</li>

<li>State how the attachment of the skull to the vertebral
column changes as the animal man assumes an erect
position.</li>

<li>Are the vertebræ of these types alike in structure?
What is the general form of an horizontally placed vertebra,
as in the horse or a reptile, and of a vertically placed
one, as in man? If you see any differences, account for
them.</li>

<li>Wherever possible, find the vertebræ of the neck
(cervical), and note the number of them in each case.</li>

<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" id="Page_169" title="[Pg 169]"></a>
How is flexibility of the column accomplished in
certain types or in certain places of one type? How is
rigidity gained? State instances in each answer.</li>

<li>Examining the interior of the turtle's "shell," find
out and explain how the vertebræ have been modified to
form the upper "shell." How has the under portion
(<i>plastron</i>) been formed?</li>

<li>In round numbers, which skeleton has the greatest
number of vertebræ and which the least?</li>

<li>Which skeleton has the greatest number of ribs,
and which has the least?</li>

<li>In a summarizing statement explain any variations
you find in the pectoral and pelvic girdle for strength
(rigidity); flexibility. This answer may be written as a
table, naming the bones, opposite each stating its condition,
and then what it affords or is adapted to.</li>

<li>What is accomplished by having two bones in the
shank of the leg? In what types or forms is there but
one, and which one is it?</li>

<li>Can you assign any advantages in power, agility,
length of leg, or position of leg and foot accruing from a
long ankle? (See horse, frog, <i>et al.</i>)</li>

<li>Enumerate the types or forms, and opposite each
state the number of fingers and toes.</li>

<li>Make a table, heading one column "Form or type";
another, "Habitat"; and a third, "Habit." Judging from
the structure which you see or from your previous knowledge
or experience, fill in the table, stating whether the
type is aquatic, terrestrial, or aërial; whether it burrows,
walks, runs, or climbs, etc.</li>

<li>From your statements in 15, explain how the
peculiar mode of life affects the structure of these types.</li>

<h5><a name="DEVELOPMENT_OF_THE_CHICK" id="DEVELOPMENT_OF_THE_CHICK"></a>5. Development of the Chick</h5>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>An incubator, a brooder, a setting of eggs.</p>


<h6>Directions.</h6>

<p>Read carefully the directions for setting up and regulating
the incubator. Remember that the temperature should
average 103 degrees and should not vary more than two
or three degrees above or below this. Candle the eggs<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" id="Page_178" title="[Pg 178]"></a>
from time to time and note difference in appearance, as
development proceeds, especially as to transparency and
size of the air space. An egg that is transparent after ten
days is probably infertile and should be removed. Eggs
which are developing properly will show from this time on
a well developed air space, and will be quite opaque. The
veins often give a spider-web appearance.</p>

<p>Twice each day remove the tray of eggs and allow to
cool slightly. Once a day the eggs should be turned before
the tray is returned to the incubator.</p>


<h6>Questions.</h6>

<ol>
<li>Describe the appearance of the shell when the chick
is about to come out. In about how many days after you
put the eggs in the incubator did you first note this change?
You should watch the incubator carefully from the eighteenth
day on.</li>

<li>What proportion of the eggs hatched? What reasons
can you suggest for the failure of some to hatch? Did any
which were pipped fail to hatch? If so, break them open
and see if you can discover the trouble.</li>

<li>How does the chick get out of the shell? How long
does it take for it to get out after the shell is chipped?
How does a chick look as soon as it has come out of the
shell?</li>

<li>With what is a chick covered when it is first hatched?
How long before feathers begin to develop?</li>

<li>How long before a chick needs food? How does it
recognize it?</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
POULTRY</h2>


<h6>Materials.</h6>

<p>Either pictures or specimens of the different breeds of
fowl.</p>


<h6>General Information.</h6>

<p>Under the term poultry are included chickens as well as
turkeys, pigeons, ducks, geese, etc. Chickens are most
generally raised, since they do not require such special conditions
as the others. In this exercise only this form of
poultry is considered.</p>

<p>The hen has been domesticated from prehistoric times,
being probably derived from the so-called jungle fowl of
India (<i>Gallus bankiva</i>), which is still to be found in its
native habitat. Through constant attempts to improve the
domestic fowl along the lines of greater egg-production,
size, etc., there have been developed a great many different
breeds of fowl. These may be divided into seven
groups, as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The American Class.</li>
<li>The Asiatic Class.</li>
<li>The Mediterranean Class.</li>
<li>The English Class.</li>
<li>The Dutch Class.</li>
<li>The French Class.</li>
<li>The Ornamental and Exhibition Classes.</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" id="Page_183" title="[Pg 183]"></a>
The American Class includes fowls raised both for egg-production
and for eating. It includes the following well-known
breeds: the Plymouth Rocks, the Wyandottes, the
Rhode Island Reds, and the less-known breeds of Javas,
Dominiques, and Jersey Blues. These all lay good-sized
brown eggs, are good winter layers, and stand confinement
well. The standard weight varies from six and one half
pounds to seven and one half pounds for the hen, and from
eight and one half pounds to nine and one half pounds for
the cock, the Plymouth Rocks being the heaviest of the
breeds.</p>

<p>There are three principal varieties of Plymouth Rocks&mdash;the
Barred Rocks, with grayish-white plumage regularly
crossed with bars of blue-black, the White Rocks, and
the Buff Rocks. All have single upright combs, which,
with the wattles and the ear lobes, are bright red, a large
bright eye, and yellow legs.</p>

<p>There are also three principal varieties of Wyandottes.
The Silver-laced Wyandotte has a silvery-white plumage,
with black markings in various parts of the body. The
Golden Wyandotte is similar in its markings, but has yellow
where the Silver-laced has white. The White Wyandotte
is pure white. All have rose combs, red ear lobes,
and yellow legs. They are on the average about a pound
lighter than the Plymouth Rocks.</p>

<p>The Rhode Island Reds are a much more recent breed
that has of late become very popular. They are of a
reddish-brown color, about the weight of the Wyandotte,
with yellow legs. There are both single combed and rose
combed varieties.</p>

<p>The Asiatic Class includes those breeds raised chiefly
for the table. The Brahmas, Cochins, and Langshans are
the chief breeds. They are considerably heavier than other<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" id="Page_184" title="[Pg 184]"></a>
breeds, and are specially characterized by the feathers on
the legs and feet. They all lay brown eggs, and are in
many cases good layers.</p>

<p>The Brahmas include two principal varieties, the light
and the dark. The general color is black and white, and
they have yellow legs, red wattles, ear lobes, and comb,
the latter being of the kind called a pea-comb, which is of
small size in the cock.</p>

<p>There are four varieties of Cochins, the Buff being
much more raised than the Partridge, the White, or
the Black. The Partridge somewhat resembles a dark
Brahma, but has red and brown plumage. Cochins have
single combs, yellow legs, and a general fluffy character
to the plumage, that of saddle and hackle meeting, thus
giving a characteristic appearance to these fowls. The
eggs are not quite so large as the other two breeds of
this class.</p>

<p>The Langshans are smaller and more active than the
two breeds just described. They have black legs, the feet
are not so heavily feathered, and in general these fowls
are much less awkward in appearance. There are two
varieties, the White and the Black.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean Class includes those breeds raised
chiefly because of their great egg-production. They are
active birds, often troublesome because of their ability to
fly over high enclosures, so that when kept in the city it is
usually necessary to clip one wing. They are not so good
winter layers as a rule, but are non-setters. They all lay
white eggs. The chief breeds included are the Leghorns,
the Minorcas, and the Black Spanish.</p>

<p>The Leghorns&mdash;the most popular of these breeds&mdash;include
two chief varieties, the Brown and the White.
The comb is most commonly single, falling to one side<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" id="Page_185" title="[Pg 185]"></a>
in the hen, the wattles long and pendulous, the ear lobes
white, and the legs yellow.</p>

<p>The Minorcas are glossy black in color, with a large
drooping comb in the hen, and long, thin, pendulous
wattle. They lay a very large egg.</p>

<p>The Black Spanish resemble the Minorcas, but are distinguished
by the white face and cheeks and the white on
the inner edge of the wattles.</p>

<p>The English Class includes the Orpingtons and the
Dorkings. The Dorkings are one of the oldest breeds of
fowl, and sufficiently identified by the presence of a fifth
toe. There are three varieties&mdash;the White, the Silver-gray,
and the Colored. The White Dorking has a rose
comb; the Silver-gray has a single comb and silvery-gray
plumage with black markings, the hen having a salmon-colored
breast; the Colored Dorkings have sometimes
single and sometimes rose combs, the plumage of the cock
being black and straw-colored and that of the hen being
black and gray with the breast salmon marked with black.</p>

<p>The Orpingtons are short legged, with close plumage.
They are of large size, the hens being from seven to eight
pounds and the cocks from nine to ten pounds. There
are three varieties&mdash;the black, the buff, and the white.
The black, except for shape, might be mistaken for a
Minorca, but has red ear lobes and black shanks. The
Orpingtons have the reputation of maturing early, some
strains being known to lay when four months old.</p>

<p>The Dutch Class includes the Red-caps, the Campines,
and the various varieties of the Hamburgs&mdash;of which
there are six: the Golden Spangled, the Silver Spangled,
the Golden Penciled, the Silver Penciled, the Black and
the White. They are all good layers and non-setters, "but
lay a small egg, white in color. They are readily recognized<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" id="Page_186" title="[Pg 186]"></a>
by their peculiar rose comb with its long, spikelike
projection in the back, their red face, white ear lobes, and
bluish legs. The prevailing color of the golden varieties
is a reddish bay marked with black and of the silver varieties
white marked with black. The cock usually has
more dark markings than the hen.</p>

<p>The Red-caps are large fowl with a red and black
plumage. The comb is similar to the Hamburg's but
larger, and the ear lobes are red.</p>

<p>The Campines resemble the Hamburgs, but have a
single comb.</p>

<p>The French Class includes the Houdans, the Crevec&oelig;urs,
and the La Fleche. The Houdans are mottled
black and white with pinkish white legs, with a fifth toe
like the Dorkings, and are easily recognized by their
peculiar crest.</p>

<p>The other breeds of fowl, like the crested Polish, Bantams,
and game fowl, have less interest for the poultry
raiser, though often seen in exhibitions and poultry shows.</p>

<p>To sum up, we may group all these breeds according to
their value into (1) the egg breeds, including the Leghorn,
Minorca, Spanish, and Red-cap; (2) the meat breeds, including
the Brahmas, Cochins, and Langshans; (3) the
general purpose breeds, including the Plymouth Rocks,
Wyandottes, Rhode Island Reds, Dorkings, and Orpingtons;
and (4) the fancy breeds, including the Polish,
Bantams, Games, etc.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
